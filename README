          deca -- a more featured editor, based on nano

Purpose:

	deca 0.3 is a fork of GNU nano 7.2 that intends to add features
while keeping the spirit and keybinds mostly the same. Some added 
features so far are: PCRE regexes, bracket highlighting, buffer tabs, and more
coming.

Appearance:

    In rough ASCII graphics, this is what deca's screen looks like:

   ____________________________________________________________________
  |  |filename||othername||anothername|                                |
   --------------------------------------------------------------------
  | This is the text window, displaying the contents of a 'buffer',    |
  | the contents of the file you are editing.                          |
  |                                                                    |
  | The top row of the screen is the 'title bar'; it shows deca's      |
  | version, the name of the file, and whether you modified it.        |
  | The two bottom rows display the most important shortcuts; in       |
  | those lines ^ means Ctrl.  The third row from the bottom shows     |
  | some feedback message, or gets replaced with a prompt bar when     |
  | you tell nano to do something that requires extra input.           |
  |                                                                    |
   --------------------------------------------------------------------
  |  deca 0.3           [ Some status message ]            [xx,xx]  xx%|
   --------------------------------------------------------------------
  |^G Help       ^O Write Out  ^F Where Is   ^K Cut        ^T Execute  |
  |^X Exit       ^R Read File  ^\ Replace    ^U Paste      ^J Justify  |
   --------------------------------------------------------------------

Origin:

	I started this project in 2024 because I loved nano's ease-of-use
and general layout and design, but felt it was missing a couple
features that I think are useful.

	As for the name, this project originally started out as "tin",
an acronym standing for "tin is nano"(an homage to nano's original name
"tip"). Unfortunatley this name was taken by an Usenet newreader so the
name was changed to deca, a pun off of nano and pico.

License:

	Idk much about licenses ngl, but this is literally a derivative work.

How to compile and install deca:

    Download the latest deca source, extract it, and then:
        cd deca-x.y
        ./configure
        make
        make install

	You will need both ncurses and PCRE installed inorder for deca to work.
